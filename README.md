## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

# Commune - A Simple Social Networking App

Commune is a basic social networking application that allows users to sign up, create posts, like, comment, and delete their own content. Built as a learning project, this app helped me understand the fundamentals of **React, TypeScript, and Firebase**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication** – Sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication.
- 📝 **CRUD Operations** – Create, read, update, and delete posts.
- ❤️ **Interactivity** – Like and comment on posts.
- 🔄 **Real-time Database** – Uses Firebase Firestore to store and manage user data and posts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase Authentication, Firestore

## 📦 Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/commune.git
   cd commune

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
